## Why Shiny?

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards.

Shiny combines the computational power of R with the interactivity of the modern web.

## Why hospital data?

This shiny app can make it easier to find hospitals in your own state, or search hospitals by other attributes!
This can make it easier for potential end users to get better access to animals.

## A preview of the solution
The solution simply filters on search terms, like demonstrated below:
```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/VBolwerk/Documents/sourectree/shiny_app")
data <-read.csv("hospital-data.csv")
head(data[data$State=="AK",])
```

## Thank you!
